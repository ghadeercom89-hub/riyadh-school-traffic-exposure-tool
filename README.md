Exposure estimation tool for school traffic in Riyadh (CIVE 442 Tool 1)
# School Traffic Exposure Comparator – Riyadh

## What does the tool do?
This tool estimates short-term PM2.5 exposure for a child waiting near traffic outside a school in Riyadh. It calculates total PM2.5 concentration and inhaled dose, and compares two scenarios (A vs B) to evaluate how changes in waiting time or traffic conditions affect exposure.

## Inputs
- Background PM2.5 (µg/m³)
- Traffic Increment ΔC (µg/m³)
- Time near road (minutes)
- Breathing rate (m³/min)

## Outputs
- Total PM2.5 concentration (µg/m³)
- Inhaled dose (µg)
- Percent change in exposure between scenarios

## How to Run
Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code and run all cells. Enter values when prompted.

## Interpretation
Results are intended for exposure reasoning and scenario comparison. Outputs are order-of-magnitude estimates, not precise measurements.
